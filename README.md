# intro

`##poland` has more extreme nerds than `##ukraine`.  this is undisputed.  but
the question is: is it a systematic difference?  e.g. is there anything special
in pierogi that makes polish ppl more superior to ukranians?

this simulation aims to answer the question:  is there a systematic cause.  it
does it by calculating the p value of this observation against the null
hypothesis (that there is no systematic difference).

# results

the claim that _polish people are superior_ could arise under the null
hypothesis with a probability of `0.3778`.

# interpretation

usually nerds like p value to be smaller than `0.05`.  but in this case, it is
`0.3778`, which is probably not small enough to reject the null hypothesis.

but at the same time, we cannot accept the null hypothesis either.  maybe with
a larger sample size we can prove pierogi's superiority.
