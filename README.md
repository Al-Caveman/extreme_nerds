# intro

1st wat is an extreme nerd?  is a nickname that exists in ##math, ##physics,
##algorithms.

turns out that `##poland` has more extreme nerds than `##ukraine`.  this is
undisputed.  but the question is: is it a systematic difference?  e.g. is there
anything special in pierogi that makes polish ppl more superior to ukranians?

this simulation aims to answer the question:  is there a systematic cause.  it
does it by calculating the p value of this observation against the null
hypothesis (that there is no systematic difference).

# results

the claim that _polish people are superior_ could arise under the null
hypothesis with a probability of `0.3778`.

# interpretation

usually nerds like p value to be smaller than `0.05`.  but in this case, it is
`0.3778`, which is probably not small enough to reject the null hypothesis.
but wat do u think?  is `0.3778` small enough to reject the null hypo?

so, i guess, we can't reject the null hypothesis (which means we cannot
demonstrate poland's superiority is systematic; could be by sheer dumb luck).

but, again, at the same time, we cannot accept the null hypothesis either.  so
we can't say that ##poland's more extreme nerds is due to sheer dumb luck.
maybe with a larger sample size we can prove pierogi's superiority.

some polish ppl claim that they and the ukranians, both, eat pierogi, but just
call it using different names.

    10:59 <Stefania> Ukrainians eat pierogi too ... they just call it pyrohy or varenyky
    10:59 <caveman> anything unique to poland?
    11:01 <Stefania> Barszcz Ukrai≈Ñski is different from Polish Barszcz with Uszka in it
